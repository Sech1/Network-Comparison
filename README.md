This is the code we used to geneate the data and graphs for homework assignment 3.

Create a report with the following information:
1. A description of how you generated the random and BA networks.
2. Determine and chart out the degree distribution of the ER network. Compare the chart to the
chart for the real network and discuss how they compare. Show both charts in your report.
3. Determine and chart out the degree distribution of the BA network. Compare the chart to the chart for the real network and discuss how they compare. Show both charts in your report.
4. What is the expected (calculated using formulas described in class) diameter and clustering coefficient of the real, ER and BA networks?
5. How do the expected values compare to the actual values for your BA and ER networks?
For All 3 Networks
6. Cluster the networks using the Louvain Modularity algorithm.
7. Present visualizations of the three graphs with the clusters shown as different colors.
8. Present a detailed table listing the number and size of the clusters.
9. Show the betweenness centrality distribution for all 3 networks as separate plots. It is ok to use
the betweenness centrality plot of the real network from the previous assignment (unless it was from Gephi).
Identify the most “important” nodes in the real network:
10. What is the highest degree node and why is it important? Does it fit the definition of a hub?
11. What is the highest betweenness centrality node and why is it important?
12. What is the highest closeness centrality node and why is it important?
13. Specify whether your real network is random, scale free, or neither.
14. Specify how your network formed and discuss how that related to whether it is random, scale
free, or neither.
15. Give several concrete reasons (involving numbers, calculations and other verifiable
justifications) why your network is random, scale free, or neither.
